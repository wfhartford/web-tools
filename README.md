# Web Tools
Some number of simple but useful web tools which make simple jobs easier.

## Why does this exist
Sometimes my wife would joke "I should have married a chiropractor.", or "Why couldn't you be a massage therapist?". Then she had a problem at work and for once I could show her why marrying a developer is always the best option. I made a little tool that makes a simple but clumsy job quick and easy.
